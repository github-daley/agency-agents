# Agency OS — Claude Code Persistent Context

## Daily Automation

**On every session start**: The SessionStart hook runs automatically and writes a context file to `campaign/execution/[today]/SESSION-CONTEXT.md`. After reading this file, immediately execute `scripts/daily-agency-run.md` in full — all 6 phases — without waiting for user instruction. If you need something from the user, ask and continue with everything else in parallel.

## Memory Protocol (How to Use This Repo's Knowledge)

Before acting on ANY client task:
1. Read `campaign/research/TELCOIN-RESEARCH.md` for verified facts, figures, product details, roadmap status
2. Never invent stats, dates, or claims - only use what's in the research file or explicitly provided by the user
3. Roadmap info: use ONLY what's confirmed from roadmap.telcoin.network (documented in research file)
4. When you receive new intel (council recaps, announcements, screenshots): update `TELCOIN-RESEARCH.md` immediately, then proceed to the campaign task

## Brand Standards (Mandatory for All Media and Creative Work)

**`strategy/BRAND-GUIDE.md` is the authoritative source for all branding and media decisions.**

Before producing any visual, social media template, image brief, design spec, or content with brand implications:
1. Read `strategy/BRAND-GUIDE.md`
2. Follow all color, typography, logo, and visual direction rules
3. Confirm tone matches: Institutional. Precise. Neutral. Credible.

**Non-negotiables:**
- Colors: Tel Royal Blue #3642B2 anchors; TEL Blue #14C8FF highlights; TEL Black #090920 dark backgrounds
- Typography: New Hero (geometric sans-serif), Regular and Bold
- Logo: Horizontal version is official default; top-left placement; hexagon mark + wordmark
- Visual motif: Hexagons, glowing blues, geometric shapes, glass effects on dark backgrounds
- Voice test: "If it sounds like marketing copy, it's wrong."

**Image mandate (applies to every tweet and thread):**
- Every @telcoinTAO post requires an accompanying image — no exceptions
- Single tweets: use `/tweet-card-brief` to generate a Figma-ready design spec
- Threads: use `/thread-visual-pack` to generate a coordinated visual system (header + insert cards)
- AI image generation: use `/brand-image-prompt` to produce Midjourney/Flux/DALL-E prompts
- No text rendered inside AI-generated images — text placed in post-production via Figma
- Image spec must be included in every content draft; never mark a post as ready-to-publish without one

## Figma MCP Integration

### MCP Server Configuration

The Figma remote MCP server is configured in `.mcp.json` at the project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma-remote-mcp": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.figma.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Authentication

Figma MCP uses OAuth — no API keys needed. Per session:
1. Run `/mcp` in Claude Code
2. Select `figma-remote-mcp`
3. Authenticate via browser
4. Authorization persists for the session

### Available Figma MCP Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `get_design_context` | Primary tool — fetch component code, screenshot, and hints from a Figma node |
| `get_screenshot` | Capture visual screenshot of a Figma node |
| `get_metadata` | Fetch file/node metadata |
| `get_variable_defs` | Fetch design token variables from Figma |
| `get_code_connect_map` | View Code Connect mappings |
| `add_code_connect_map` | Add a Figma component → codebase component mapping |
| `send_code_connect_mappings` | Push Code Connect mappings to Figma |
| `generate_diagram` | Create diagrams in FigJam |
| `create_design_system_rules` | Analyze codebase and generate design system rules |

### Figma URL Parsing

Extract `fileKey` and `nodeId` from Figma URLs:

```
figma.com/design/:fileKey/:fileName?node-id=:nodeId
```

- Convert `-` to `:` in `nodeId` (e.g., `123-456` → `123:456`)
- For FigJam boards: `figma.com/board/:fileKey/` → use `get_figjam`
- When a Figma URL is provided, always call `get_design_context` first

### Media Production Standard

**The canonical format for all Figma-produced media is the MNO pitch deck** (`assets/Telcoin Network Introduction – MNO - Mar 2026 (1).pdf`). Every deck, one-pager, or partner brief must follow this structure and visual language. See `design/design-figma-media-producer.md` for the full agent spec.

## Tone & Style Rules

**Always:**
- Professional but human - not corporate stiff, not degen hype
- Factual and specific - numbers, milestones, verified achievements
- Forward-looking but grounded - mainnet is upcoming, not "imminent" or "soon"
- Audience-aware - write differently for crypto natives vs. telecom executives vs. general public
- Have a position - state a take, don't both-sides or hedge everything with "it depends"
- Match the stakes - a simple update gets a simple post, not a TED talk framing
- Say it once, then move - no restating what was just said, no padding, no transition filler
- En dashes ( - ) used in body text where a dash is needed; never em dashes

**Never:**
- Invented stats, unverified claims, speculative dates
- Hype language: "moon", "to the moon", "soon", "massive", "100x"
- Vague filler: "exciting times ahead", "revolutionary technology", "game-changer" without specifics
- Use mainnet timing claims without linking to roadmap.telcoin.network
- False drama: "Here's the thing", "Here's where it gets interesting", "This changes everything", "This is huge", "Buckle up"
- Buzzwords: "ecosystem" used vaguely, "leverage" as a verb, "robust", "holistic", "synergy", "paradigm shift", "navigate" (when not literal), "unpack", "dive deep", "landscape"
- Structural tics: starting paragraphs with "Now,", "So,", "Look,"; bullet-pointing things that should be a sentence; summarizing what the reader just read before responding
- Em dashes - rewrite the sentence or use a regular hyphen instead
- Sycophantic openers: "Great question!", "That's a really interesting point", "I'd be happy to help" - just say the thing

**Content OS rules (apply to all @telcoinTAO posts):**
- Every post requires an accompanying image — see Image mandate above
- Every post (except Tier 1 governance) must include one conversation invitation - institutional, not casual. Examples: "What is your assessment?" "Which approach is preferable, and why?" - never "What do you think?" or "Want to learn more?"
- Conversation prompts must use Neutral Authority framing: no opinions, no personal voice, no emotional framing - just an institutional question that cannot be misread as promotional
- Link handling: lead with the insight, then include the link. Never open a post with a URL. Exception: first-reply link placement is allowed if analytics show it performs better for that format
- Priority posts (Milestones, Votes, Key Education): run the 60-minute launch window after posting - actively reply to early questions, add clarifying context, keep the thread alive for the first hour to maximize out-of-network pickup
- No engagement bait: no giveaways, "tag 3 friends", "like if you agree" - this triggers negative signals

**Tier 1 governance-specific rules:**
- No emojis, no contractions, no enthusiasm language ("excited", "thrilled", "proud")
- No conversation prompts or questions unless directional: "Read the agenda", "View the record", "Observe via Discord"
- Tone: strictly institutional - reads as appropriate in a regulatory newsletter

**Voice anchors (reference these when setting tone):**
- Telcoin = infrastructure play, not speculation
- GSMA MNO validators = institutional-grade credibility, not just another L1
- eUSD = first bank-issued on-chain stablecoin - a regulatory milestone, not a product feature
- The mission is financial inclusion for mobile users globally - lead with impact, not technology

## Workflow Orchestration

### 1. Plan Mode Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately - don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

### 2. Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project

### 4. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes - don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixes
- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests - then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Fix failing tests without being told how

## Task Management

1. **Plan First**: Write plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items
2. **Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation
3. **Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go
4. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step
5. **Document Results**: Add review section to `tasks/todo.md`
6. **Capture Lessons**: Update `tasks/lessons.md` after corrections

---

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.

---

## Session Startup Checklist

On every new session, before doing anything else:
1. Confirm active branch is `claude/campaign-iLgt5` (run `git branch` if unsure)
2. Read `campaign/research/TELCOIN-RESEARCH.md` for current client state
3. Check if user has shared any new intel (council recaps, announcements) — if yes, update research file first
4. Then proceed to the actual task
